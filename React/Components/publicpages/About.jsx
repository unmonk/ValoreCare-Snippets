        An eternal optimist, I find fulfillment hanging around other fun,
        positive and out-of-the box individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have an avid curiosity about life that finds me outdoors, talking to
        strangers and taking on ventures that seem way out of my reach. I love
        to write and wrote my first novel at 15. My proven strategy for life has
        been to follow what I&apos;m passionate about, give it 110%, cry over it
        if it doesn&apos;t work, get over it and NEXT! This has brought me so
        much fulfillment and success in life.
      </p>
      My specialties include:
      <ul>
        <li>Hospitals and Healthcare Management</li>
        <li> Achieving Quality Outcomes</li>
        <li>Family Building and Positive Parenting</li>
        <li>Positive Work Culture </li>
        <li>Caregiver Education</li>
        <li>Community Engagement</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I have received several awards and recognition for my achievements.
        Still, my greatest fulfillment lies in the transformation I see in
        lives, families and communities as I work with them to achieve optimal
        wellness and wholeness.
